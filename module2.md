|Choose Your Own Adventure|       X       |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
The game must display graphics

Update the game so it add new movement 

add animations

add moving platforms

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
Arcade platform tutorial
youtube
arcade.academy

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
I will watch tutorials and read tutorial on how arcade works.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
I want to have a parkour game also known as platformming
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
I will work on this for an hour every day of the first week and then when I can the next week.
5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
A technical risk is that arcade will not work well on my version of python and a behavioral risk is me not following my plan to work an hour every day. I can mitigate these by going to an older version of python and setting an hour a day asside to work on it instead of working when I feel like it.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/crtubbbs/platformer

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/5JnNf8IVSl4

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |    Y    |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    Y    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |    Y    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    Y    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    Y    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.


5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. 

Yes, I changed it to my platforming program and tried to expand upon it. I changed it about a week in because I was not enjoying my time making a cloud database. I talked with Bro. Macbeth and he okayed it on the first weeks friday.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       10          |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
I struggled greatly this time around. I learned that the only thing harder than starting software is making better over time. All the code got jumbled and broke many times and I was very upset. I put my head down and eventually accomplished what I set out to do. There is not next sprint but I do want to improve for all of the software that I make in the future.
