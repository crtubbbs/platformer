|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
The game must display graphics

The game must take user input from the keyboard or mouse

The game must have moveable objects

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
Arcade platform tutorial
youtube
arcade.academy

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
I will watch tutorials and read tutorial on how arcade works.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
I want to have a parkour game also known as platformming
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
I will work on this for an hour every day of the first week and then when I can the next week.
5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
A technical risk is that arcade will not work well on my version of python and a behavioral risk is me not following my plan to work an hour every day. I can mitigate these by going to an older version of python and setting an hour a day asside to work on it instead of working when I feel like it.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

Add music or sound effects to the game.

Provide levels in your game that change the difficulty of the game.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. N

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       15          |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
I actually did almost all of it in the first week. I enjoyed this sprint a lot so I spent a lot of time working on this project and making it as good as I can. I want to carry this forward for next sprint because when I enjoyed it everything was much easier.
